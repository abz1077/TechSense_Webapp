    "title": "Google I/O 2021: Event Date, What to Expect, and More",
    "text": "Google had to entirely cancel its I/O developer conference last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the company is prepared to make some \u2018significant announcements\u2019 this time around. This year, Google I/O 2021 is free for everyone, and the Mountain View giant announced the dates of the event earlier this month. Google I/O 2021 is entirely virtual, and in this article, we will take a look at the expected announcements at the event.\n\nGoogle I/O 2021 Dates\n\nTo recall, Google I/O 2021 is all set to be held from May 18 to May 20. You can register for the event right now from Google\u2019s dedicated event website. After registration, you can attend workshops, AMA sessions, live Q&A during sessions, get developer profile badges, and more during the event. Apart from this, we could also expect key consumer-centric product announcements at the event.\n\nWatch Google I/O 2021\n\nAs always, you can watch Google I/O 2021 keynote from Google\u2019s official YouTube channel. The event link is not available as of this writing, but we will update this post with the event link when it becomes available. Further, you can stay tuned to the I/O website for specific events.\n\nExpectations for Google I/O 2021 Keynote\n\nWith the basics out of the way, let\u2019s get to the exciting hardware and software you can expect to be announced at the event:\n\nAndroid 12\n\nAndroid 12 will be one of the key highlights at the event. While Google won\u2019t roll out the finalized build of Android 12 to Pixel phones soon after the event ends, you could expect the first Android 12 beta release. Meanwhile, you can catch up on the best Android 12 features from our linked article.\n\nIn case you\u2019re out of the loop, Google has already released three developer previews. Going forward, there will be four beta releases in May, June, July, and August, respectively. Android 12 will reach platform stability in August, and you could expect the stable Android 12 release sometime in September.\n\nLike last year, we could expect Android 12 beta builds from OEM partners for specific devices alongside Pixel phones. Notably, this will be the last major Android update for Pixel 3 and 3 XL. Here are the Pixel devices that will get Android 12:\n\nGoogle Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL\n\nPixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL\n\nGoogle Pixel 4\n\nPixel 4a and Pixel 4a (5G)\n\nGoogle Pixel 5\n\nGoogle Pixel 5a\n\nAlright, let\u2019s talk about the Pixel 5a. Following rumors of Pixel 5a\u2019s cancelation, Google stepped up to reveal that the Pixel 5a is not canceled and will launch later this year. In addition, the company also revealed we could expect the device launch to be in line with last year\u2019s Pixel 4a unveiling. In case you don\u2019t remember, Pixel 4a launched in August last year.\n\nHere\u2019s where things get interesting. In an ideal world, Google would have announced the Pixel 4a at I/O 2020, just like how it revealed the Pixel 3a series at I/O 2019. However, since I/O 2020 didn\u2019t happen, the launch was pushed to August. Going by these, there\u2019s a chance that Google could announce the Pixel 5a at I/O 2021, with market availability set for August or even June.\n\nOn the hardware front, the Pixel 5a 5G is rumored to pack a 6.2-inch Full-HD+ OLED display with the same Snapdragon 765 SoC seen on the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5. With all that said, one area where there\u2019s little to no reason to be excited about is availability. A Google spokesperson has already confirmed that the Pixel 5a 5G will be limited to the U.S. and Japan.\n\nPixel 5a Launch in India?\n\nSo, what about the BIS certification of the alleged Pixel 5a with model number GR0M2 and that ET Telecom report shedding light on Google\u2019s grand India push? Well, we\u2019re not sure either. The global chip shortage has likely forced Google to hit the pause button on its ambitious plans to widen its presence in the country. If Google skips the Pixel 5a 5G launch in India, that could mean there will be no new budget Pixel phone in India this year. That leaves Pixel fans with Pixel 4a that made its way to India last October. Clearly, it is not a great time to be a Pixel fan in India, and the situation is far from ideal. C\u2019mon Google, do something.\n\nPixel Buds A\n\nGoogle Pixel Buds A is the company\u2019s upcoming truly wireless earbuds expected to launch at the event. It was rumored to launch sometime in April, and the next best timeline is at Google I/O 2021. Another evidence for its existence is a recent marketing email where Google accidentally leaked the Pixel Buds A design. Spoiler alert: They look pretty much like Pixel Buds 2, but with a green shade.\n\nIn terms of specifications, we don\u2019t know a lot about the Pixel Buds A. Judging by the \u2018A\u2019 in the branding, it could be a cheaper variant of the Pixel Buds. Further, a recent 9to5Google report suggests that the Pixel Buds A may lack gesture inputs for controlling the volume. Hence, do not get your hopes high for the new Pixel Buds A. We will have to wait a little longer for the true successor of Pixel Buds 2.\n\nWhitechapel Chipset Announcement?\n\nRumors about Google\u2019s in-house SoC codenamed Whitechapel started last year. After a year of silence, a 9to5Google report earlier this month further detailed Google\u2019s plans to use its own chipset, starting with the Pixel 6 5G. Google seems to have teamed up with Samsung Semiconductor\u2019s system large-scale integration (SLSI) division for the much-awaited Whitechapel chipset.\n\nSpeaking of the technical tidbits, as per recent reports, it will be an octa-core chipset manufactured on Samsung\u2019s 5nm process. It could include two ARM Cortex-A78 cores, two Cortex-A76 cores, and four Cortex-A55 cores. While you should not expect Google to announce the Pixel 6 at I/O 2021, it is likely that Google will announce the Whitechapel chipset so that developers know what to expect and how to prepare when it is ready.\n\nWear OS Improvements and New Nest Hardware\n\nNow that Google owns Fitbit, we could expect the company to announce improvements to Wear OS and Fitbit OS at I/O 2021. Interestingly, Google could drop \u2018OS\u2019 and simply call it Google Wear, as revealed in the I/O schedule. Another possible outcome is the announcement of new Nest hardware products. Another possibility is the rumored Pixel Watch, but even the leaks point to an October release date.\n\nIn Alphabet\u2019s Q1 2021 earnings call, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told investors to expect \u2018significant product updates and announcements.\u2019 Hence, there\u2019s room for a slew of product announcements at the event.\n\nImprovements to Google Assistant, Stadia\n\nGoogle usually announces massive improvements to its voice recognition technology at I/O, take Duplex, next-gen Google Assistant, for instance. Google I/O 2021 will be the perfect time for the company to show off advancements it has achieved with Assistant throughout the year. The company, however, has already announced a few Assistant updates, including pronunciation accuracy improvement and natural conversations using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We could also get a glimpse of what the future holds for Stadia, Google\u2019s cloud gaming efforts.\n\nGoogle I/O 2021 Expectations\n\nSo, that sums up our expectations for Google I/O 2021. Which of these announcements are you most excited about? If I had to pick one, it would have to be Google\u2019s in-house Whitechapel chipset and its capabilities, followed closely by Android 12.

    "title": "Xiaomi Working on Three New High-End Android Tablets: Report",
    "text": "Xiaomi shifted its focus away from the tablet segment after launching the Mi Pad 4 back in 2018. With Xiaomi out of the equation, brands including Samsung, Huawei, Lenovo, and even Amazon with its Fire tablets dominated the Android tablets segment. However, if a new report from XDA Developers is anything to go by, it appears as though Xiaomi is planning to make a strong comeback in the foreseeable future.\n\nXiaomi\u2019s Upcoming Android Tablets\n\nAccording to the report, Xiaomi is allegedly working on at least three Android tablets. These devices have the codenames \u2018nabu\u2019, \u2018enuma\u2019, and \u2018elish\u2019 respectively. In addition, these codenames are referenced in methods like \u2018isPad\u2019 in the source code of multiple MIUI 12.5 system apps.\n\nApart from this, Xiaomi tipster kacskrz has spotted a settings page demonstrating system navigation for tablets in a recent alpha build of the MIUI Home app (version 4.22.0.3089). Take a look at the settings page below:\n\nThe report also reveals the model names of Xiaomi\u2019s upcoming tablets. While the devices with codenames \u2018enuma\u2019 and \u2018eilish\u2019 will have the model names K81 and K81A respectively, the tablet with the codename \u2018nabu\u2019 has the model name K82. In addition, it looks like just \u2018enuma\u2019 (K81) will offer LTE/5G cellular connectivity.\n\nComing to the key specifications, all three models are tipped to have an IPS LCD display with up to 120Hz refresh rate and 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution. Moreover, \u2018nabu\u2019 (K82) is likely to have a 10.97-inch display with 236mm x 148mm dimensions. It could also equip an 8,720mAh dual-cell battery. K81 and K81A are expected to feature chipsets built on Qualcomm\u2019s sm8250 platform \u2013 Snapdragon 865, 865+, or 870, while K82 could feature Qualcomm\u2019s sm8150 platform \u2013 Snapdragon 855, 855+, or 860.\n\nXiaomi has the infrastructure and potential to be a key player in the Android tablets industry. With these new tablets, the company could be looking to compete against the likes of Samsung and Apple. For now, we will have to wait to see when these tablets will see the light of day in the coming months. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun has already confirmed that the company will launch new tablets sometime later this year.",

    "text": "India\u2019s Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has given mobile service providers, including Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea (Vi), and MTNL, permission to start 5G trials in the country. These network providers will conduct 5G trials across India and will cover rural, semi-urban, and urban areas.\n\n5G Trials in India\n\nFor conducting 5G trials, the aforesaid network operators will work with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM). While Reliance will use its own indigenous technology for network trials, other telecom companies have teamed up with Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, and C-DOT. Notably, none of these OEMs are from China. This also means that Huawei and ZTE are not involved in India\u2019s 5G trials.\n\nTelecom operators will conduct trials across different 5G bands, including mid-band (3.2 GHz to 3.67 GHz), millimeter-wave band (24.25 GHz to 28.5 GHz), and sub-Gigahertz band (700 GHz). The trials are set for 6 months. The 6-month timeline includes 2 months period for procurement and setting up of the equipment.\n\nThese trials will be isolated and not connected with existing networks. Moreover, it will be held on a non-commercial basis, and data generated during the trials will be stored in India. The ministry also expects telcos to test indigenously developed use cases and equipment as part of the trials.\n\n\u201cThe objectives of conducting 5G trials include testing 5G spectrum propagation characteristics especially in the Indian context; model tuning and evaluation of chosen equipment and vendors; testing of indigenous technology; testing of applications (such as telemedicine, tele-education, augmented/ virtual reality, drone-based agricultural monitoring, etc.); and to test 5G phones and devices,\u201d DoT said in a press statement.\n\nThe government also urges telcos to conduct trials using 5Gi technology. Developed by IIT Madras, Centre of Excellence in Wireless Technology (CEWiT), and IIT Hyderabad, the government claims that 5Gi \u201cfacilitates much larger reach of the 5G towers and Radio networks.\u201d",

It didn\u2019t show off other key specifications either. What we know according to a recent 9to5Google report is that the earbuds may lack swipe volume gestures. However, we will not have to wait longer to find out as Google is expected to unveil the Pixel Buds A at I/O 2021. We\u2019ll be covering the event as it happens, so stay tuned for more updates.",

    "text": "The creators of TikTok clone Chingari have launched a new Made in India Clubhouse clone that they call Fireside. The company calls it India\u2019s first voice-based social media app, which is not entirely true. There exists an app called Leher with similar features, and it has been around since 2018.\n\nFireside App on Android and iOS\n\n\u201cThe fireside app is a social networking app that lets you follow, and form connections with like-minded individuals.

    "text": "Following in the footsteps of Instagram, YouTube is testing the possibility of replacing the Explore tab with a dedicated Shorts tab in the app\u2019s bottom navigation bar. Anmol from our team spotted the test on his phone, running YouTube beta version 16.17.36. After a quick Twitter search, we noticed that YouTube started testing this change on both Android and iOS earlier last week.\n\nYouTube Shorts Tab in YouTube App\n\nTo put things in perspective, here is a comparison between the current YouTube app\u2019s home page and the upcoming redesign that should probably roll out soon. As seen in the image below, the Explore section is given less prominence in the test version. YouTube has shifted the Explore section to the top-left corner of the app, right where Shorts currently exists.\n\nYouTube\u2019s decision to move the Shorts tab to the bottom navigation bar doesn\u2019t come as a surprise, considering how much momentum short video apps like TikTok have gained lately. However, what I don\u2019t like about the new implementation is that the Shorts section continues to show up on the home page despite having a dedicated tab in the navbar. The idea of pushing Shorts through YouTube\u2019s home page even after giving it a prominent spot in the YouTube app feels like the company is trying too hard, at least in my opinion.\n\nAs of writing this article, YouTube has not widely rolled out the new Shorts tab just yet. However, we could expect it to happen over the coming weeks. If you\u2019re a creator, now will be a great time to go through our list of YouTube Shorts tips to leverage the upcoming boost in user activity and engagement.",

    "text": "Realme has launched a new Bluetooth speaker in Malaysia earlier this month. Dubbed the Realme Cobble Bluetooth speaker, one unique aspect of the new speaker is that its lanyard (read: strap) glows in the dark. Let\u2019s take a look at the complete specifications of Realme\u2019s latest Bluetooth speaker:\n\nRealme Cobble Bluetooth Speaker: Specifications\n\nRealme Cobble Bluetooth Speaker comes with 5W dynamic drivers and offers three equalizer presets \u2013 Bass, Dynamic, and Bright. You can pair two speakers together for stereo sound.\n\nFor connectivity, the speaker utilizes Bluetooth 5.0 with a range of 10 meters. The speaker supports AAC and SBC codecs. Realme has also added a Game Mode that claims to bring the latency down to up to 88ms while playing games or watching videos.\n\nAt 200 grams, the Cobble Bluetooth speaker is portable and you can easily clip it to your backpack or hang it in your dorm room. Moreover, the IPX5 water resistance should protect the speaker from occasional splashes. Coming to the fancy glowing effect, it is worth pointing out that just the blue version\u2019s lanyard has this characteristic. In other words, the Black variant of the speaker won\u2019t glow in the dark.\n\nThe 1500mAh battery on the speaker lasts up to 9 hours, Realme claims. Charging the speaker completely will take approximately 2.5 hours. Fortunately, Realme has used a USB-C port on this one. You can use the Realme Link app to customize the preferences for the speaker.\n\nPrice and Availability\n\nThe Realme Cobble Bluetooth Speaker is available in Electric Blue and Metal Black color variants. It costs 99 MYR, which roughly translates to Rs. 1,800. There\u2019s no word on the availability in other regions just yet, but we will keep you updated if Realme brings this speaker to India.",

    "text": "On the first day of the Apple vs Epic Games trial set in Oakland, California, lawyers representing Apple and Epic Games put forth their stances. While Epic highlighted Apple\u2019s walled garden and how the company is being monopolistic with the way it handles software distribution on iOS along with 30 percent commission, Apple argued that Epic Games wants them to be Android.\n\nEpic Games Wants Us to Be Android: Apple\n\n\u201cEpic wants us to be Android, but we don\u2019t want to be. And our consumers don\u2019t want that either. They want the choice,\u201d Apple lawyer Karen Dunn was quoted as saying by CNBC. It was further added that Apple built the iOS App Store and gets to set the rules and policies, ensuring that the apps uploaded by developers are high-quality and secure. That is also a reason why the Cupertino giant does not allow side-loading apps like Android.\n\nThe development comes when Apple and Epic\u2019s lawyers made their opening statements. Epic went ahead and showed a walled garden in its presentation. You can go through the slideshows showing Apple\u2019s and Epic\u2019s slides over at The Verge.\n\nIt all started when Epic Games decided to sue Apple for removing Fortnite from the App Store. Apple even terminated Epic Games\u2019 developer account weeks after the incident. In case you\u2019re out of the loop, Apple removed Fortnite because Epic introduced a direct payment system that bypasses Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut.\n\nThis is just the beginning of the trial. Over the coming weeks, key tech personalities from Apple including Tim Cook, Eddy Cue, Craig Federighi, Phill Schiller, and more are expected to testify. Some of these will be in-person while some will happen through Zoom. The entire trial is expected to last three weeks.\n\nIf Epic wins the trial, Apple may get forced to allow third-party payment methods for apps in the App Store. Another possibility in the instance of a favorable ruling is the permission to set up its own app store. That would mean Epic Store offering apps and games on the iPhone. Right now, we\u2019ll have to wait to see how the story unfolds.",

According to a recent tweet on the company\u2019s official Twitter handle, Redmi will launch the smartwatch alongside Redmi Note 10S in the country on May 13.\n\nRedmi has set up a dedicated event page for the product launch. From this page, it\u2019s clear that the upcoming product is indeed the Redmi Watch. Take a look at the announcement tweet below:\n\nGet ready to #WearYourVibe peeps! \ud83d\ude0e#Redmi's FIRST<hush hush> is all set to arrive with the #SavageBeast #RedmiNote10S on 13/05/21! \ud83e\udd73 Got what it takes to pass that #vibecheck? \u2705\n\nKeep your eyes on our page! \ud83d\udc40 Get Notified: https://t.co/YHvH7ZBIgR RT if we got you vibin! pic.twitter.com/Lf7uHcyWdn \u2014 Redmi India \u2013 #RedmiNote10 Series (@RedmiIndia) May 4, 2021\n\nRedmi Watch: Specifications\n\nSince Redmi has already launched the Redmi Watch in China last November, we know the key specifications of the gadget. This smartwatch launched globally as the Mi Watch Lite.\n\nTo recall, the smartwatch sports a 1.4-inch square color LCD touch panel with 323 PPI. You get over 200 watch faces to customize the look and feel. Health-related features include 30-day heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, 11 sports modes, and more.\n\nOne key difference with the Redmi Watch coming to India is GPS support. Unlike the Chinese variant that lacks built-in GPS, the Indian Redmi Watch variant will offer built-in GPS/GLONASS for navigation. This way, you don\u2019t have to carry your phone if you\u2019re going for a walk or a cycle ride. This puts the upcoming Redmi Watch closer to the Mi Watch Lite than its Chinese variant.\n\nSince Xiaomi is known to follow an aggressive pricing strategy for Redmi devices, it will be interesting to see how the upcoming wearable is priced in India. The presence of onboard GPS support should make the gadget an appealing choice in the country. We\u2019ll be covering Redmi\u2019s launch event on May 13 as it happens, so stay tuned for more details.",

Ryan goes on to say that developers are already working to connect Discord with social and gaming experience on PlayStation Network.\n\nThe move comes just months after the messaging giant was allegedly in talks with Microsoft in a whopping $10 billion acquisition deal. However, according to a WSJ report from last month, Discord has halted discussions with Microsoft and would rather go for an IPO. With over 140 million monthly users, Discord is a popular voice chat app among gamers.\n\nThe said integration on PlayStation Network should make it convenient for gamers to communicate with other players, especially on cross-platform games like Apex Legends.

    "text": "Microsoft\u2019s Chromium-based Edge browser has been my go-to browser since it was launched and for good reason. The browser offers a lot of useful features, support for Chrome extensions, and more. And now, Microsoft seems to be working on yet another useful feature for it.\n\nAccording to the latest Edge Dev channel update, Microsoft is testing a new Office file viewer inside the Edge browser. The option was enabled by default for me with the latest Edge Dev 92.0.873.1 update. However, if you don\u2019t have it enabled, here\u2019s where you can find it.\n\nGo to edge://settings -> Downloads. You will find the new \u201cQuickly view Office files on the web using Office Viewer\u201d option here. Just enable the toggle and you\u2019re good to go.\n\nSo what does this feature do? Well, up until now, if you searched for presentations, Word documents, or even spreadsheets online and clicked on a direct link to a ppt, docx, or xls file, your browser would just download it. With this new feature, however, the file will open in the Edge browser itself. In fact, for things like presentations, you also get a handy slideshow mode within the browser now, as well as a Notes pane.\n\nIf you actually intended on downloading the file, you can still use the Download button in the toolbar to download the presentation or document to your computer. If you use Bing Search, the functionality has been integrated into it pretty well too. Basically, for links leading to Office Files, you will now see a handy \u2018Web View\u2019 option right next to the link which will open up the file inside Edge\u2019s new Office Viewer.\n\nThis feature should prove way more useful to students than it will ever prove for me, but I\u2019m fairly excited about it, even if I\u2019ll only ever use it a couple of times in my life. As mentioned above, the feature is available in Edge Dev, and not on the stable channel. So, there\u2019s no telling when (or if) it will be made available to the wider public, but stay tuned.",

The app has over 75 million transacting users, as per data available from May last year. This growth has been helped along by the continuous addition of new and useful features within the app, including bill payments and recharges.\n\nNow, Google is working on bringing support for contactless UPI payments in the Google Pay app. The news comes from the folks over at Android Police who spotted the feature explained in the Google Support pages.\n\nWith this new feature, you will soon be able to simply tap your phone on payment terminals and complete your payments, without having to scan QR codes or enter contact numbers in your Google Pay app. Moreover, since the feature will use UPI for transactions, you don\u2019t need to really change anything on your end. You can simply tap your phone on a compatible payment terminal (currently only PineLabs POS systems are supported), and your phone will automatically launch Google Pay. Then, you can simply enter the amount to be paid, followed by your UPI pin, to complete the payment.\n\nObviously, you will need to have a smartphone with an NFC chip inside, and Google has some more security standards as well. Right now, it seems the feature will only be available on Android phones. Google says that your phone\u2019s software should be Play Protect certified for the feature to work. Moreover, the feature might not work with phones running developer versions of Android, custom ROMs, etc. You can head over to this support page to see the compatibility requirements for the UPI over NFC feature.",

The smartphone launches in the country in 10 days, on May 13, as per a tweet by Xiaomi India MD, Manu Kumar Jain.\n\nMi Fans, get ready for the most #Savage #RedmiNote of 'em all. Savage #Performance meets Stunning #Camera with all-new #RedmiNote10S. \u26a1 Join us as we unveil this BEAST at a special #LaunchFromHome event on 13th May! \ud83c\udfe1 RT & get notified: https://t.co/TnHWHCOAYN I \u2764\ufe0f #Redmi pic.twitter.com/FfADJkHA5H \u2014 Manu Kumar Jain (@manukumarjain) May 3, 2021\n\nThanks to the global launch, we already know everything there is to know about the smartphone, including the design and all the tech specs you may want to be aware of. The Redmi Note 10S\u2019 design is reminiscent of the recently launched Mi 11X as well as the Redmi Note 10 series, especially as far as the camera module is concerned. That said, the Redmi Note 10S\u2019 camera module is slightly more squared off than the one on the Mi 11X.\n\nIn terms of specs, the Redmi Note 10S will come with a 6.43-inch AMOLED display, with a resolution of 2400\u00d71080, DCI-P3 color gamut, 409PPI pixel density, and 1100nits of peak brightness.\n\nUnder the hood, the phone is powered by the MediaTek Helio G95 processor that has a Mali-G76 MC4 GPU for gaming and graphics. In the global markets, Xiaomi has launched the Redmi Note 10S in three variants: a 6GB/64GB option, 6GB/128GB option, and an 8GB/128GB option at the highest-end. These storages are all UFS 2.2, so not the fastest options out there.\n\nThe smartphone will also pack in a quad-rear camera setup. That includes a 64MP primary rear camera. This will be coupled with an 8MP ultra-wide, a 2MP macro, and a 2MP depth sensor. A 13MP front camera for selfies will also be in tow. All of that, with a pretty chunky 5,000mAh battery complete with support for 33W fast-charging will round this phone off as a pretty solid contender in the space.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the price that the Redmi Note 10S will be launched at in India. However, it is expected to be within the Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 15,000 price bracket. It will also be interesting to see how the phone fits in alongside the Redmi Note 10 series, which is priced starting at Rs. 12,499.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Redmi Note 10S launches on May 13 in India, and we will be covering the launch, so stay tuned for more updates.",

Now, a new reveal is out, hinting that the game might relaunch with a completely new name, and it\u2019s not going to be PUBG Mobile India.\n\nAccording to a new poster for the game spotted by the folks over at Gemwire, Krafton and PUBG Corp. are likely to release the game under the name \u2018Battlegrounds Mobile\u2019.

For those unaware, the website went live late last year when the developers announced that they will be relaunching the game soon.\n\nThe poster, shown in the image above, has the image of a PUBG player landing on what looks to be Miramar (or the new Karakin map), with the text Battlegrounds Mobile India written in the sandy terrain.\n\nAs for the actual launch, there is yet to be any official announcement, but recent developments have definitely amped up expectations yet again. Krafton recently posted more job listings related to PUBG Mobile India on LinkedIn. Moreover, the company has stated in interviews that it is focused on the PUBG Mobile relaunch instead of bringing the newly announced PUBG: New State to the country. What\u2019s more, a bunch of PUBG Mobile India teaser videos went live on the official YouTube channel a few days ago, adding more fuel to the fire. The videos have been made private since then, but their appearance does seem to indicate that the game\u2019s launch, hopefully, is just around the corner.\n\nMeanwhile, even as Krafton struggles to bring PUBG Mobile back, EA\u2019s Apex Legends has started its closed beta in the country, and FAU-G\u2019s Team Deathmatch mode is on the way as well. It remains to be seen how well \u2018Battlegrounds Mobile\u2019 will be able to fare in a more competitive mobile gaming scene in India.",

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 Images Leaked",
    "text": "Ever since Samsung launched its first Galaxy Fold foldable smartphone, the company has been expanding its line up, releasing smartphones such as the Galaxy Z Fold 2 and the Galaxy Z Flip in the market. Now, after releasing three new Galaxy Book laptops and 2-in-1 devices at its recent \u201cUnpacked\u201d event, the Korean company is looking to release two new foldable devices in the coming days, namely the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Galaxy Z Flip 3. And recent leaks show the devices in all their glory.\n\nSo, ahead of their potential release in the coming weeks, promotional images of the book-style foldable Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the clamshell-style foldable Galaxy Z Flip 3 leaked online recently. The images show the designs and the physical form factor of the devices.\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 Images Leaked\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold (Leaked)\n\nStarting with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, as per the leaked images, we can see that the device comes with a vertical triple-camera module that looks pretty different from the Contour-cut camera design of the latest Galaxy S21-series.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nMoreover, there is an image of the Galaxy Fold 3 that shows the device with the S-Pen, confirming previous rumors about the device. Furthermore, it is slated to be the world\u2019s first foldable smartphone with an under-display selfie snapper and come with a new Hybrid S-Pen.\n\nMoreover, Samsung will also reportedly integrate a new \u201cArmor\u201d into the display, hinge, and bezel to improve the durability of the device. Besides, the outer screen will reportedly come with the Gorilla Glass Victus for better drop protection and preventing scratches. It will come in three new colors \u2013 black, white, and a sea-green-like color scheme.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 3 (Leaked)\n\nComing to the Galaxy Z Flip 3, the leaked images suggest that the device will come in a variety of colors. In fact, Samsung, as per the images, has implemented a new two-tone color design for the Galaxy Z Flip 3 that subtly hides the front cover display.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nMoreover, the cover display can now show more information than the cover display on the previous Galaxy Z Flip. As per a leaked image, unlike on the cover display of the previous iteration, you will be able to read a whole text message on the new cover display of the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 3. Plus, it will also reportedly come with the Gorilla Glass Victus.\n\nComing to the cameras, we can see a dual-camera setup beside the cover display. Although not much information is available about the optics of the device as of now, it should bring significant improvement over its predecessor.\n\nAvailability (Rumored)\n\nComing to the launch date of the devices, Samsung has not officially confirmed anything. However, as per reports and the leaked Samsung product roadmap, the company might release the devices sometime in July this year. So, stay tuned for more information in the coming weeks.",

    "text": "Over the past few years, we have seen a rise in popularity, as well as values of various cryptocurrencies in the market. Amongst some of the most popular ones like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, Dogecoin, which is a cryptocurrency based on a meme, saw a huge surge in its value when billionaire Elon Musk started tweeting about it. And going by Elon\u2019s words, a 33-year-old now says that he has become a millionaire by investing in the said cryptocurrency.\n\nGlauber Contessoto is 33 years old and is a resident of Los Angeles. The guy is a fan of the Tesla CEO and after Musk started tweeting about Dogecoin a few months ago, Contessoto went in and bought 5 million Dogecoins at around $0.045 (~Rs. 3.3) on February 5.\n\nOn April 15, Contessoto shared a screenshot (attached below) of his Robinhood account on the r/dogecoin subreddit that showed the value of his investment to be a little over $1 million. So, it took around 69 days for him to become a Dogecoin millionaire.\n\nNow, after buying the initial 5 million Dogecoin, Contessoto shared a video on his YouTube channel to explain the top 5 reasons that drove him to invest in cryptocurrency. You can check out the 18-minute video right below:\n\nSo, in the video, Contessoto says after Elon Musk started tweeting about Dogecoin, he decided to invest in it. As a result, he took out all the savings from his bank accounts, sold his shares of Tesla, Uber, and invested every penny to buy the initial Dogecoins.\n\nAlthough many of his friends and family member warned him about the risks involved, he chose to stick to his plan of becoming a Dogecoin millionaire. And guess what? He really did become one.\n\nFeatured Image Courtesy: Glauber Contessoto (YouTube)",

    "title": "This Device Can Turn Your Food Waste into Nutrient-Rich, Odorless Compost",
    "text": "As global climate change continues to impact the environment, the need for the hour demands better waste management techniques to reduce the amount of waste in the world. Amongst others, food waste is comparatively easier to manage as it can be turned into nutrient-rich composts. However, the process of composting is long-drawn and time-consuming. So, to let people easily compost food waste at their homes, a Canada-based company has created a mini composter that turns food waste into compost with a push of a button.\n\nLomi: Compact Home Composter\n\nDeveloped by Pela, Lomi is essentially a rice-cooker-shaped device that can convert biodegradable waste into nutrient-rich compost. As a result, users can throw in just about anything biodegradable, including food waste, those wooden cutleries that you get with food deliveries, and even the company\u2019s compostable phone cases to turn them into mess-free, odorless compost. It uses heat, abrasion, and oxygen to turn the waste into environment-friendly compost.\n\nThe company says that North America alone generates around 330 billion pounds of food waste each year. These add up with the plastic and other non-biodegradable waste to fill up landfills and cause global warming. So, with Lomi, Pela wanted to eliminate food waste from the mix to reduce the cumulative amount of waste.\n\nThe company says that it worked on Lomi for three years, trying out thousands of composting processes. Following the initial researches, the team spent a lot of time prototyping the device to make it compact and house-friendly. And now, Pela is finally ready to mass-produce Lomi to deliver it to customers around the world.\n\nPrice and Availability\n\nThe company is currently running an Indiegogo campaign for Lomi and has already raised close to $4 million from over 11,000 backers. So, if you want to pre-book the device from the campaign page.\n\nThe device is priced at $379 (~Rs 28,082) for people living in Canada, Puerto Rico, and the USA. Other than these countries, the international model, which the company will ship to any country in the world, comes for $399 (~Rs 29,564).",

    "title": "20 Best Instagram Reels Tips and Tricks",
    "text": "Instagram Reels, along with YouTube Shorts, has emerged as one of the most popular TikTok alternatives. Featuring a wide array of AR effects, hilarious stickers, and a solid library of music for lip-syncing videos, Reels has got almost everything covered to be a hot pick among both creators, as well as folks who wish to experiment with short-form videos. Whether you are a newbie or hunting for hacks to enhance your skill, these are the 20 best Instagram Reels tips and tricks that can help you step up your game.\n\nBest Instagram Reels Tips and Tricks for 2021\n\nAs a creator, we aspire to be one of the best in the business. Producing highly engaging videos that can grab eyeballs and compel onlookers to send a ton of hearts is where the bucks stop. But how do you create attention-grabbing content, and what are the tools required to make pro-level Instagram Reels?\n\nWell, we have taken all the aspects into account and included tips that can help boost your fortune on the short video-sharing platform. Now let\u2019s dive in and take a look at the top Instagram Reels tips and tricks in 2021.\n\n1. Find Your Niche and Post Clips Frequently\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be a jack of all trades, do you? While there is nothing wrong with being a person who can be good in several departments, you should always strive to be the master of one craft. It is essential if you dream of becoming one of the most loved Instagram Reels creators.\n\nWhat are you good at? Do you have the dancing skill that can steal the show? Can you attract viewers with your looks and lip-sync craft? Do you have a passion for flaunting a chiseled body and beefed up muscles, or do you have the heart to perform jaw-dropping stunts?\n\nAll I\u2019m trying to stress is that you need to find the niche you wish to rule and go all out to put your best effort. Remember, when you have only a few seconds to impress, nothing less than a blitzkrieg or admirable reel can garner hearts and likes.\n\n2. Presentation Matters\n\nBefore you create a Reel, ask yourself a couple of simple questions. Why may anyone want to watch the clip? And what could be the right pitch for your reel? These couple of questions can help you prepare and keep any oversights at bay, which are common when you go all-in with very little preparation.\n\nOnce you have answered the fundamental questions, craft the presentation with precision. Think about each move and the impact it will leave behind. You can check out one of our cool \u2018How did we go from this to that\u2019 Instagram Reel right here. The timing and precision of your moves are important to gravitate users towards your content.\n\n3. 30/60 Seconds is Always Better Than 15 Seconds\n\nAt launch, Instagram Reels allowed users to record only 15 seconds of video. However, when creators asked for a bit more freedom in terms of time, the Facebook-owned video-sharing platform had to double the video recording time. And now, it has bumped the video recording time even further, all the way to 60 seconds.\n\nSo, if you are still stuck at the 15 seconds loop or don\u2019t know how to increase the length, let me tell you that switching between 15, 30, or 60 seconds is pretty straightforward. Tap on the tiny circle button (showing 15 seconds by default) at the top of the camera tools to hop between 15, 30, or 60 seconds.\n\n4. Hidden Tool to Adjust Video Length\n\nHave you ever wished to adjust the length of your Instagram Reels after recording but don\u2019t know how to do it? It happened to me when I started taking an interest in Reels and wanted to create some funky clips. But just when I was about to look for third-party tools to fine-tune the length of Instagram Reels, I discovered the hidden tool inside the Timer itself.\n\nTo get going, tap on the video length button to switch between 15, 30, or 60 seconds. Then, tap on the Timer button. After that, drag the slider to adjust the length of the video. Besides, you can also adjust the countdown before you go ahead and record your clip.\n\n5. Get Your Timing Right\n\nConsidering how pivotal timing is for perfecting each move or expression, you should never miss out on any trick to get as close to perfection as you can. Before getting into action, tap on the timer button. After that, tap on the tiny button next to the countdown to switch between 3s and 10s seconds. Next, tap on Set Timer.\n\n6. Never Forget to Align Your Instagram Reels\n\nThis is the Instagram Reels trick that should stick with your forever. The Reels feature comes with a built-in video alignment tool that you can use to align your clips with ease. Once you have recorded the video, tap on the video alignment button. It gets the job done reliably and without hampering your productivity.\n\n7. Slow Down or Speed Up Your Video\n\nOne of my favorite Instagram Reels features is the native speed adjustment tool. Whether you want to slow down your reel or speed it up to make it appear more dramatic, you don\u2019t need to look anywhere else to fine-tune the speed of your video.\n\nBefore recording the clip or after you have captured the video, hit the speed button (1x) and select the desired option. While .3x and .5x allow you to slow down your clip, the 1x, 2x, 3x, and 4x let you speed it up.\n\n8. Experiment with Effects & AR Filters\n\nInstagram Reels already boasts a ton of eye-catching effects. And if you think that the number is as good as the last time you strolled into the effects collection, you can\u2019t be more wrong. The video-sharing platform keeps rolling out new effects to let you spice up your video.\n\nSo, every time you wish to start or partake in an Instagram Reels trend, dive into the effects collection (tap on the effects button) and try out a myriad of effects until you are pleased.\n\n9. Keep Camera Tools at the Preferred Side\n\nWhile some folks prefer to keep things on the right-hand side, others like to go with the left-hand side option. It enables them to carry out their work more conveniently. That\u2019s probably the reason why Instagram Reels allow you to choose which side of the screen the camera toolbar should be.\n\nWhen recording a reel, tap on the settings button at the top left corner of the screen and then choose the left or right-hand option. The creation tools appear on the left by default. I think this is an essential trick for all Instagram Reels creators.\n\n10. Clip Your Music Precisely\n\nClipping music or selecting the desired part shouldn\u2019t be a hassle when you have a neat tool always ready to do the task for you. Simply, tap on the music button and then search for the songs you want to use. Once you have selected the preferred track, use the slider to choose the desired part of the track. It\u2019s that easy!\n\n11. Keep Your Captions Short and Precise\n\nCaptions that are short and sweet catch attention right away, while the ones that cover the entire screen fail to grab attention. The best way to nail Instagram Reels captions is to play with words. And with it, I mean using the caption that can send your message loud and clear at a glance, of course, without sacrificing the style factor.\n\n12. Use Eye-Catching Covers \u2013 Best Instagram Reels Trick\n\nThey rightly say, \u201cThe first impression is the last impression.\u201d Thus, make sure to design your Instagram Reels cover with precision so that it can best represent your video.\n\nBoth App Store and Play Store are loaded with a plethora of highly-rated photo editors. However, the ones that have always impressed me are Adobe Lightroom (iOS and Android; Free with in-app purchases), VSCO (iOS and Android; Free with in-app purchases), and Snapseed (iOS and Android). They are feature-rich and come with a wide range of photo editing tools to let you design your Reels cover. So, give them a shot and I\u2019m sure you would soon begin to see the difference.\n\nChanging Instagram Reels cover is easy. Tap on the video with the \u2018Caption\u2019 tag (on the sharing screen) and then hit the \u201cAdd from Camera Roll\u201d button. After that, select the custom cover.\n\n13. Automatically Save Your Instagram Reels to Your Device\n\nFor a keepsake, I prefer to save Instagram Reels on my device. Whenever I wish to go back in time and take a close look at all the clips that I have uploaded on the video-sharing platform, I can explore the collection at my own pace. If you also belong to the same school of thought, follow the steps below:\n\nTap on the settings icon at the top left corner. After that, tap on Reels.\n\nat the top left corner. After that, tap on Reels. Next, turn on the switch next to Save reels to device.\n\n14. Stay in Sync with Trends, But As a Trendsetter\n\nWhile it\u2019s always recommended to hop onto the latest trend to stay ahead of the curve, you must always add something new to the table. Think of adding quirky laughter into the mix or a peculiar expression with a wry smile or the childish face that compels onlookers to take notice.\n\nWhenever a piece of music or style tops the chart, many folks run after it so much that it begins to look redundant. While the ones who grabbed the trend early on with immaculate act run away with the hearts, mere followers hardly get much appreciation. The trick is either be the first (or among the first batch) or add something different to the concept to make it appear more striking.\n\n15. Use Third-party Video Editing Software\n\nDespite having a stunning lip-syncing or acting skill, your reel won\u2019t get the desired appreciation unless you\u2019ve edited it beautifully. Without undermining the plethora of effects and stickers that Reels come loaded with, I recommend you to make your clip using pro video editors.\n\nBelieve me, video editing had never been so easy-going before. Of course, it does take a while to master all the tricks of the trade, but there are quite a few super handy video editors that can let you adorn your clips instantly. And that too without being embroiled in a lengthy learning curve or tedious process. If you are willing to get started on the right note, check out our lineup of the best Instagram Reels video editors.\n\n16. Buy Lights for Your Instagram Reels Shoots\n\nWhen creating action-filled videos, the one thing that comes calling is the crazy lighting you want to use. After all, it\u2019s the light that invites the camera and action to kick in. Fortunately, getting the best lights for Reels is not a big deal, thanks in part to many highly-rated LED lights that you can buy from Amazon at $30-$50.\n\nMost of the LED lights work with the companion app on Android and iOS to let you customize colors based on the theme of the video. So, whether you want to brighten up the colors or wish to go vibrant, you can do it all and more with utmost ease.\n\n17. Never Settle with the Native Music Library\n\nMusic is the crux of any video, more so for the clips that have only a few seconds to leave a lasting impression. So, why settle with the songs that don\u2019t seem to gel along with your video? Agreed, Instagram Reels come with a boatload of tracks to choose from, and most of the time, you may not have to look beyond them.\n\nBut if you fully rely on Instagram Reels\u2019 built-in music library, chances are pretty high that you might soon find the library insufficient for your out-of-the-box clips. And that\u2019s when you would need to look beyond. But bother not, there are several reliable sites that offer legal and free music. So, the next time you want to use some unique music in your video, do keep this Instagram Reels trick in mind.\n\n18. Give A Personal Touch to the Audio\n\nIt\u2019s always better to give your personal touch to the music, which not only sets your content apart but also showcases your creative aspect. As someone who has a penchant for sharing fun-loving videos, I like to fine-tune audio and also add voiceover (on some occasions) to make it different.\n\nAdobe Audition, Logic Pro X, and Audacity are undoubtedly the best audio editors that you can use to customize your audio proficiently. However, if you want to go for easy-to-use free audio editors, I recommend you try out Presonus Studio One and Ardour. Head over to our extensive roundup of the best audio editing softwares for more information.\n\n19. Use Audio from Other Instagram Reels\n\nHave you ever run into a cool Instagram Reel and wished you could use that audio for your own Reel? Turns out, the video-sharing platform provides an official way to use original audio from other Reels. To get it done, open the Reel whose audio you want to use. Then, tap on the \u201cOriginal Audio\u201d option located at the top of the video.\n\nOn the next screen, tap on the Use Audio button at the bottom. Next, you will be directed to the Reels camera, where you can start recording with the original audio. Do note that the original audio is always credited to the original creator.\n\n20. Remix Instagram Reels to Create Exciting Clips\n\nRecently, Instagram introduced a long-awaited feature called \u201cRemix\u201d that is similar to TikTok\u2019s Duet. Going by the trend, remixed videos have been getting a lot of attention on the video-sharing platform. Whether you want to parody existing reels or wish to make a match with a popular video, Remix can have a role to play. So, be sure to incorporate this Instagram Reels trick into your arsenal to widen your exposure.\n\nBear in mind that the Remix feature is enabled only for new videos by default. So, if you want to go all new, you will need to manually enable it for your old reels.\n\nTo get started with Instagram Reels, launch Instagram and then open a Reels video. After that, tap on the three dots menu and select Remix This Reel. Now, go ahead and either record a new response video or choose one from your camera roll. As usual, you have effects and built-in editing tools to adorn your reel. When you are happy with your creativity, add a suitable caption and share it.\n\nIf you want to enable Remix for old videos, tap on the three dots menu at the bottom right corner and choose Enable Remix option. To find out more about Remix and how it works, head over to our detailed guide on how to use Instagram Remix Reels feature.\n\nSuper Handy Instagram Reels Tips and Tricks to Stay Ahead in 2021\n\nThere you go! So, these are some pro Instagram Reels tips and tricks that can keep you ahead of the curve. Now that you have got a good hang of short video creation, you can make the most of these tips to excel in all the pivotal aspects. Remember, it\u2019s nothing but a genuine and engaging piece of content that can make you the star on Instagram Reels.
